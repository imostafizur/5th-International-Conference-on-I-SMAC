# Paper Title: IoT-Based COVID-19 Suspect Smart Entrance Monitoring System.

Abstractâ€”The concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) encompasses
the connection and monitoring of various remote objects in the real
world through the Internet. The COVID-19 is very infectious, and
it spreads super-fast by contacting other COVID infected people.
There have been few works on COVID detection and prevention
in resent time. However, none of the existing works proposed any
automatic IoT-based remote blocking system so our work is an
autonomous system to stop entering in the campus the COVID
suspected. The aim of this work is to detect COVID-19 suspect
people and stop them from contacting other people. We have
implemented our system using IoT devices. Our proposed system
first measures the body temperature and Second measures blood
oxygen level checks whether it exceeds the World Health
Organization (WHO) recommended body temperature and blood
oxygen level. In case of high body temperature or low blood oxygen
level, the system blocks the person from entering the campus and
sends an email to the suspected people notifying their illness. The
most advantage of our system is working autonomously, cost-
effective, and easy to implement on any campus or office.
